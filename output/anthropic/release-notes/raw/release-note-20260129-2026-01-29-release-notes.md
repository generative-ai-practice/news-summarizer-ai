- [Structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) are now generally available on the Claude API for Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Claude Haiku 4.5. GA includes expanded schema support, improved grammar compilation latency, and a simplified integration path with no beta header required. The `output_format` parameter has moved to `output_config.format`. Existing beta users can continue using the beta header during the transition period. Structured outputs remain in public beta on Amazon Bedrock and Microsoft Foundry.
