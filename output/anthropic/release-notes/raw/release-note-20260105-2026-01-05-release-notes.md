- We've retired the Claude Opus 3 model (`claude-3-opus-20240229`). All requests to this model will now return an error. We recommend upgrading to [Claude Opus 4.5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview#latest-models-comparison), which offers significantly improved intelligence at a third of the cost. Researchers can request ongoing access to Claude Opus 3 on the API through the [External Researcher Access Program](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9125743-what-is-the-external-researcher-access-program).
