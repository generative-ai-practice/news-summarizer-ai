- We've launched [programmatic tool calling](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling) in public beta, allowing Claude to call tools from within code execution to reduce latency and token usage in multi-tool workflows.
- We've launched the [tool search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool) in public beta, enabling Claude to dynamically discover and load tools on-demand from large tool catalogs.
- We've launched the [effort parameter](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) in public beta for Claude Opus 4.5, allowing you to control token usage by trading off between response thoroughness and efficiency.
- We've added [client-side compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk) to our Python and TypeScript SDKs, automatically managing conversation context through summarization when using `tool_runner`.
